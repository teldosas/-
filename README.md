The name of the project is the greek word for Pharmacies on Duty. It is an app written in BackboneJS with Google Maps integration. The user can select a district and a range of dates and see which pharmacies are on duty. By clicking on a pharmacy the user can see the map with the location of the pharmacy in a popup.

[Here](http://hersonissospharmacy.com/efim/) is a live instance of the application.
